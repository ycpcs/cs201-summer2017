GUIs

Event-driven
  Event happens: user input, timer, etc.
  Program *handles* the event

Architecture:
  Model - the *data* (representation of problem domain)
  View - (1) render the model, (2) handle user input
  Controller - logic (updates to model)

Problem domain: model and controller
UI: view

UI can use problem domain classes

Problem domain classes *must not* use UI classes
