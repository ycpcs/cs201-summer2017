Java and Eclipse
================

All of the software we are using is open source (free). I encourage you to download it to install on your own computer.

-   [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) This is required to run Java programs. Make sure you download the JDK, not the JRE.  Make sure you get version 1.8 or later.
-   [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) - This is the Java development environment we are using in class. It has a number of variants. You should get the **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers**.
